# my-vim
A repo that contains my up-to-date configuration for a preferred .vimrc file.

It uses `Vundle` as the plugin manager of choice. To use properly:
    - Copy the `.virmc` file found in this repo to `~/.virmc` (overwrite if it exists already)
    - Create a `~/.vim/bundle` directory if it doesn't already exist
    - Open up vim and type `:PluginInstall` to start up the plugin loading process
